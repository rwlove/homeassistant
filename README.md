# homeassistant

** Work In Progress **

This is my personal Home Assisstant build and configuration. The Dockerfile has some ugly hacks so that I can use my local (not docker's) DHCP server. I hope to move to a newer version of Docker soon that might allow me to remove the need for running dhclient.

TODO
-Certs don't work, so cannot access webui outside of home network
-Light dimming on Phillips Hue doesn't work
