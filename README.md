# homeassistant

** Work In Progress **

This is my personal Home Assisstant build and configuration. The Dockerfile has some ugly hacks so that I can use my local (not docker's) DHCP server. I hope to move to a newer version of Docker soon that might allow me to remove the need for running dhclient.
